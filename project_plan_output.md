## Output & Visualization

To effectively communicate insights derived from our data analysis and modeling, we are leveraging a robust suite of Python-based visualization tools that integrate directly into our data science workflow. These visualizations will not only support our research questions but also offer accessible, interpretable insights for stakeholders and non-technical audiences.

### Tools & Approach

We currently use inline visualization libraries including:

- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for foundational and statistical plots
- **Plotly** for interactive dashboards and geographic visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling and clustering evaluation
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and statistical summaries

These tools enable seamless integration into Jupyter notebooks for iterative exploration and model evaluation, ensuring our visual analysis stays tightly coupled with data processing steps.

### Visual Outputs by Research Question

#### RQ1: Predictive Analytics – Can Health Care Access Predict Chronic Conditions?

- **ROC Curves**: Compare the predictive power of multiple chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease) using area-under-curve metrics to assess model discrimination performance.
- **Confusion Matrix Heatmaps**: Evaluate model accuracy by visualizing prediction vs. actual outcomes for chronic condition classification.
- **Feature Importance Plots**: Show correlation-based importance of chronic conditions in predicting healthcare access, guiding feature selection and model refinement.

**Example Output Code**:  
`plot_roc_curves()`, `plot_confusion_matrix()`, `plot_feature_importance()`

---

#### RQ1 (continued): Statistical Analysis – Differences in Prevalence Based on Access

- **Box and Violin Plots**: Compare age and income distributions for individuals with and without specific chronic conditions.
- **Chi-Squared and T-Test Tables**: Backed by tabular outputs evaluating the statistical significance of observed differences.
- **Multi-panel Dashboards**: Present summary panels including condition prevalence, healthcare access by income, and geographic distribution for stakeholder-ready communication.

**Example Output Code**:  
`create_dashboard()`, `plot_state_choropleth()`

---

#### RQ2: Demographic Clustering – Who Is Disproportionately Affected?

- **K-Means Clustering Scatter Plots**: Visualize clusters based on demographic features (e.g., age and income), with centroids showing population subgroup centers.
- **Health Disparity Heatmaps**: Cross-tabulate race/ethnicity and income to show disease burden across intersecting demographic axes.
- **Parallel Coordinates Plots**: Explore multidimensional demographic-health profiles, identifying overlapping patterns in high-risk groups.

**Example Output Code**:  
`plot_kmeans_clusters()`, `plot_health_disparities()`, `plot_parallel_coordinates()`

---

#### RQ3: Unsupervised Learning – Can Hidden Patterns Be Revealed?

- **Hierarchical Clustering Dendrograms**: Show relationships between chronic conditions through co-occurrence clustering.
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Plans**: Future consideration for overlapping clusters when a probabilistic approach is preferred.
- **Clustering Validation Metrics**: Include silhouette scores and Davies-Bouldin Index for model performance evaluation.

**Example Output Code**:  
`plot_dendrogram()`

### Planned Enhancements

To expand our visualization capabilities, we are considering:

- **GMM and PCA-Based Cluster Visuals**: For more nuanced and overlapping cluster detection
- **Time-Series or Longitudinal Plots** *(if data permits)*: To observe condition onset or access patterns over time
- **Streamlit or Dash Deployments**: For interactive, shareable dashboards accessible beyond notebooks
